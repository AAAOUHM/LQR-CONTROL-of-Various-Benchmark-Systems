# LQG(LINEAR QUADRATIC GAUSSIAN)-control-method-for-various-benchmark-systems
we have done type 1 servo control of various commonly used system, by linearizing the system at the operating point. then designed a lqr(regulator) controller and a kalman filter (estiamator) to do the full state estimation from the mesumurements.
1. liquid level control in 2 interacting coupled tanks       2. position control of a cart with inverted pendulum on it         3. height control of an  iron object using magnetic levitation      4.    vehicle suspension control
