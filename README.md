# LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) Control for Benchmark Systems

This project demonstrates the application of **LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) control** to several classical benchmark systems in control theory.  
The approach combines:  

- **System Linearization** at the chosen operating point  
- **LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)** design for optimal state-feedback control  
- **Kalman Filtering** for full-state estimation from noisy measurements  

The integration of regulator + estimator achieves robust **Type-1 Servo Control** for practical systems.
